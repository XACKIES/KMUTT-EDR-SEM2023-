## Introduction 
Shell Eco-marathon 2023 is a world-renowned competition that challenges students from around the globe to design, build, and drive energy-efficient vehicles. The competition promotes innovation and sustainable mobility through real-world engineering challenges. In this year’s event, a team of engineering students from King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) proudly participated in the Urban Concept category, which focuses on vehicles that are closer to practical, roadworthy designs suitable for city use, combining efficiency with comfort and safety.

The KMUTT team consisted of passionate students from various engineering disciplines including mechanical, electrical, electronic, and computer engineering. Through collaboration and hands-on experience, they aimed to push the boundaries of fuel efficiency while promoting environmentally friendly transportation solutions. This project served as both an academic challenge and an opportunity to apply interdisciplinary knowledge, reinforcing the students’ commitment to innovation and sustainability on a global stage.
